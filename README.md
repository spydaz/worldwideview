---

WorldWideView is a real-time geospatial engine visualizing live global data on an interactive 3D globe. Utilizing a dynamic "All-Bundle" plugin architecture, independent data sources—like live aircraft, maritime vessels, or conflict events—are ingested and rendered decoupled from the core 3D viewer.

## Key Features

- **"All-Bundle" Plugin Architecture**: Ingest any data source dynamically without touching the core platform.
- **High-Fidelity 3D Rendering**: Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles and LOD modeling powered by CesiumJS.
- **Real-Time Data Pipeline**: High-frequency WebSocket updates managed by a custom `DataBus`.
- **Advanced Entity Management**: Automatic horizon culling, chunked primitive rendering, and 3D stacking/spiderification.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Download and sync new plugins directly from the UI.
- **Agent Bus (opt-in)**: HTTP+SSE control surface that lets an external tool — typically an MCP server fronting an LLM — fly the globe, toggle layers, and select entities in the running browser session. Default off; see [Agent Bus docs](docs/agent-bus.md).

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript 5
- **3D Engine:** CesiumJS + Resium (Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles)
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Event Bus:** Custom typed `DataBus` for high-frequency WebSocket updates
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma 7
- **Deployment:** Docker multi-stage build, Coolify

## Project Architecture

WorldWideView separates the data acquisition layer from the frontend rendering loop, using a real-time event bus to bridge them.

```

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v9+)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for self-hosting or full local dev)
- PostgreSQL (or rely on the `coolify-db` / local compose container)

## Quick Start (Self-Hosting)

WorldWideView uses a multi-stage Dockerfile designed for standalone output. To deploy instantly on your own server:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
mkdir worldwideview && cd worldwideview
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silvertakana/worldwideview/main/setup.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
mkdir worldwideview; cd worldwideview
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silvertakana/worldwideview/main/setup.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | Invoke-Expression
```

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure you connect a PostgreSQL database via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for production deployments.

## Quick Start (Local Development)

To run the source code locally for contributing or developing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silvertakana/worldwideview.git
cd worldwideview
pnpm install
pnpm run setup   # generates .env.local with AUTH_SECRET
pnpm run dev:all # boots the UI, cache layers, and the data engine
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the live globe.

## Project Structure

The codebase utilizes a `pnpm` monorepo configuration:

```text

├── src/                  # Core frontend app
│   ├── app/              # Next.js App Router (pages, API routes)
│   ├── components/       # Shared UI, Globe panels, and 3D layouts
│   ├── core/             # DataBus, Polling, PluginManager, Store
│   └── plugins/          # Built-in plugins and registry logic
├── packages/             # Monorepo packages

├── prisma/               # Database schemas & migrations
└── .agents/              # Agent rules, workflows, and documentation
```

## Plugin Ecosystem

WorldWideView operates on an open-core philosophy. The platform itself is data-agnostic; all data sources are dynamically imported as plugins at runtime.

- **[Plugin Quickstart Guide](docs/plugin-quickstart.md)**: Learn how to scaffold and link your first plugin using the `@worldwideview/cli`.
- **[Advanced Plugin Guide](docs/plugin-advanced.md)**: Deep dive into microservice data seeders, WebSockets, complex 3D rendering, and Marketplace publishing.

## Repository Ecosystem

WorldWideView is distributed across several specialized repositories:

1. **`worldwideview`** (This Repo): Main frontend, CesiumJS rendering engine, and core plugin framework.
2. **`wwv-data-engine`**: Open-source community data backend for polling public APIs.
3. **`worldwideview-plugins`**: First-party maintained plugins.
4. **`worldwideview-marketplace`**: The web application driving the plugin directory.
5. **`worldwideview-web`**: Marketing and landing site.
6. **[`szski/wwv-mcp`](https://github.com/szski/wwv-mcp)**: Reference MCP server for driving the globe from an LLM agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, …) via the [Agent Bus](docs/agent-bus.md). Contributor-hosted today; may move under the project org.

## Development & Workflow

- **Branching & Commits:** We strictly enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`). Every commit should utilize our semantic versioning `[/commit]` workflow.
- **Coding Standards:** We emphasize vanilla CSS (no Tailwind), strict TypeScript 5, and file modularity (max 150 lines per file).
- **Testing:** We use Vitest with `jsdom`. All new core logic should be accompanied by tests, running via `pnpm test`.

See [Docs: Development](docs/development.md) and [Docs: Testing](docs/testing.md) for more details.
